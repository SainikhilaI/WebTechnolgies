    Now, Sofia’s mom is the queen of Enchancia and Sofia is the princess. 
    The trouble is, Sofia doesn’t really know anything about being a princess. She never had to do a royal wave, she is not sure when to curtsy, or even which fork to use at dinner! “I’ll never be as perfect a princess as my new step-sister Amber,” Sofia says.
